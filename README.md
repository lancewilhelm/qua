# Qua

Open source QDA software running on Vue + Nuxt.js + Supabase and a little bit of Tailwind CSS.

If you are going to develop this project yourself, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

That should do it for now...more to come.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm run build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm run preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```
